	<p>
		The mission of Christian French Trust is to empower our Father's faithful to be driven entrepreneurs 
		to build generational wealth and create freedom—spiritually, financially, and personally—by aligning 
		their businesses with our Father's Kingdom principles. We are committed to helping believers design 
		a lifestyle where they can work purposefully, live abundantly, and serve generously, using their 
		God-given gifts to make a lasting impact on their families, churches, and communities. 
		Through mentorship, integrity, accountability and biblical stewardship, we equip individuals to 
		step into their calling to help grow the Kingdom of Heaven.
