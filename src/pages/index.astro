    Can You Build a Business That Frees You and Still Honors God?
  </h2>

  <p>
    At <strong>CFTrust</strong>, we help believers create purpose-driven income streams that multiply their time, impact, and Godly
    influence—without burning out or compromising their values.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe your business should be a reflection of <strong>God's calling</strong>—not just a way to earn a living. We equip
    Christian entrepreneurs to design lives of margin, meaning, and eternal impact through simple, scalable business strategies
    rooted in <em>biblical wisdom and the teachings of Jesus Christ</em>.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">What Did Jesus Say Matters Most?</h3>

  <p>
    We’re glad you asked. Jesus gave us a clear foundation for how to live:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic text-lg my-6">
    "'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.'
    This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'
    On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."
    <br />
    <span class="block mt-2 text-right">— Matthew 22:37–40</span>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    In simple terms, we are to love God and love others with our whole being. This is the heart of what we teach at CFTrust.
    We show how to give everything you have, everything you are, and everything you will be—to the glory of God’s Kingdom.
  </p>

  <p>
    He created it all—it’s already His. We’re called to be <strong>faithful servants</strong> and good stewards of the provisions He has
    placed in our lives. Your blessings aren’t just for you—they are tools for blessing others.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">The Kingdom Is Waiting</h3>

  <p>
    God's Kingdom has wealth beyond comprehension, waiting to be placed into the hands of those who have humbled themselves and seek
    to do His will. Show Him that you are a good and faithful servant, and <em>He will withhold nothing from you</em>.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-green-500 pl-4 italic text-lg my-6">
    “Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do.”<br />
    <span class="block mt-2 text-right">— John 14:14</span>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Never underestimate the power you carry once your heart is fully aligned with the Father’s will. The enemy delights in lukewarm
    Christians living in lack, paralyzed by doubt. But the Father is <strong>ready</strong>. He’s waiting for you to move.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-yellow-500 pl-4 italic text-lg my-6">
    “Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for
    your souls. But you said, ‘We will not walk in it.’”<br />
    <span class="block mt-2 text-right">— Jeremiah 6:16</span>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Don’t let that be your story. Commit to the advancement of the Kingdom of God and <strong>start walking</strong>. David wasn’t loved
    because he was flawless—he was loved because he was fearless and faithful. The same love is available to you if you seek His face.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-purple-500 pl-4 italic text-lg my-6">
    “Whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men.”<br />
    <span class="block mt-2 text-right">— Colossians 3:23</span>
  </blockquote>
