				Can you build a business that frees you and still honors God?
			</h3>
                        <p>
				At CFTrust, we help believers create purpose-driven income streams that multiply their time, impact, and Godly 
				influence—without burning out or compromising their values.
			</p>
				We believe your business should be a reflection of God's calling—not just a way to earn a living. 
				We help equip Christian entrepreneurs to design lives of margin, meaning, and eternal impact through 
				simple, scalable business strategies built on biblical wisdom and the teachings of Jesus Christ.
			</p>
			<p>
				What are the teachings of Jesus that we should be following? We're glad you asked. Jesus said,
				<blockquote><i>"'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.' 
				This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.' 
				On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." — Matthew 22:37-40</i></blockquote>
			</p>
			<p>
				Basically we are to love God and each other with our "everything". How do you do that? This is the core of what we
				teach at CFTrust. We teach how to give everything you have, everything you are, and everything you will be to the glory
				of the Kingdom of God. He created everything, so it's all His anyway. We are to be faithful servants of the Father, be
				good stewards of his provisions in our lives, and the use our blessings to be a blessing to others.
			</p>
			<p>
				God's Kingdom has wealth beyond all comprehension just waiting to be placed into the hands of those who have humbled 
				themselves before God and are seeking to do His will. Show Him you are a good and faithful servant and He shall hold
				nothing back from them that simply ask. Jesus said,
				<blockquote><i>“Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do.” — John 14:14</i></blockquote>
			</p>
			<p>
				Do not underestimate the power that you wield once you have aligned yourself with the Father's heart. The Devil loves
				nothing more than luke warm Christians living in poverty talking about all the great things they would do in Jesus' name if only
				God would fill their bank accounts one day. The Father wants to hold nothing back from those that continually strive to achieve
				glory in His honor. He is patiently waiting on you! What are YOU waiting for?
			</p>
			<p>
				This is what the Father says,
				<blockquote><i>“Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, 
				and you will find rest for your souls. But you said, ‘We will not walk in it.’” — Jeremiah 6:16</i></blockquote>
			</p>
			<p>
				Why do you NOT? Commit yourself to the advancement of the kingdom of God and start walking. David was loved by the Father,
				not because he was flawless, but because he was a fearless man of action, of unwaivering belief that God would deliver him.
				The Father has this same love for you if you will seek His face, and do not doubt in his power.
			</p>
			<p>
				<blockquote><i>“Whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men.” — Colossians 3:23</i></blockquote>
			</p>

				If you’ve been blessed by this message and believe in the mission of advancing God’s Kingdom through faith-filled work, we 
				invite you to prayerfully consider supporting this ministry. Your generosity helps us equip believers, spread the gospel, 
				and build resources that impact lives for eternity. Every gift, no matter the size, is an act of worship and obedience—and 
				together, we can do more for His glory than we ever could alone. Thank you for sowing into the Kingdom.

    Can You Build a Business That Frees You and Still Honors God?
  </h2>

  <p>
    At <strong>CFTrust</strong>, we help believers create purpose-driven income streams that multiply their time, impact, and Godly
    influence—without burning out or compromising their values.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe your business should be a reflection of <strong>God's calling</strong>—not just a way to earn a living. We equip
    Christian entrepreneurs to design lives of margin, meaning, and eternal impact through simple, scalable business strategies
    rooted in <em>biblical wisdom and the teachings of Jesus Christ</em>.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">What Did Jesus Say Matters Most?</h3>

  <p>
    We’re glad you asked. Jesus gave us a clear foundation for how to live:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic text-lg my-6">
    "'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.'
    This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'
    On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."
    <br />
    <span class="block mt-2 text-right">— Matthew 22:37–40</span>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    In simple terms, we are to love God and love others with our whole being. This is the heart of what we teach at CFTrust.
    We show how to give everything you have, everything you are, and everything you will be—to the glory of God’s Kingdom.
  </p>

  <p>
    He created it all—it’s already His. We’re called to be <strong>faithful servants</strong> and good stewards of the provisions He has
    placed in our lives. Your blessings aren’t just for you—they are tools for blessing others.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10">The Kingdom Is Waiting</h3>

  <p>
    God's Kingdom has wealth beyond comprehension, waiting to be placed into the hands of those who have humbled themselves and seek
    to do His will. Show Him that you are a good and faithful servant, and <em>He will withhold nothing from you</em>.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-green-500 pl-4 italic text-lg my-6">
    “Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do.”<br />
    <span class="block mt-2 text-right">— John 14:14</span>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Never underestimate the power you carry once your heart is fully aligned with the Father’s will. The enemy delights in lukewarm
    Christians living in lack, paralyzed by doubt. But the Father is <strong>ready</strong>. He’s waiting for you to move.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-yellow-500 pl-4 italic text-lg my-6">
    “Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for
    your souls. But you said, ‘We will not walk in it.’”<br />
    <span class="block mt-2 text-right">— Jeremiah 6:16</span>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Don’t let that be your story. Commit to the advancement of the Kingdom of God and <strong>start walking</strong>. David wasn’t loved
    because he was flawless—he was loved because he was fearless and faithful. The same love is available to you if you seek His face.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-purple-500 pl-4 italic text-lg my-6">
    “Whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men.”<br />
    <span class="block mt-2 text-right">— Colossians 3:23</span>
