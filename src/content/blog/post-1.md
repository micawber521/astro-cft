### Whose Slave Are You?  
##### Understanding Romans 6:16

> *“Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey—whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness?”*  
> — **Romans 6:16 (NIV)**

#### The Choice We All Make

Whether we realize it or not, **every day we are submitting ourselves to something**—to habits, to thoughts, to desires, to influences. The Apostle Paul doesn’t mince words in Romans 6:16: we are either **slaves to sin**, which leads to **death**, or **slaves to obedience**, which leads to **righteousness**.

It’s a strong word—*slave*. In modern times, we bristle at it. We prefer to think of ourselves as autonomous, free to do what we want. But the truth is, **we’re never truly free from influence**. We're always serving something or someone.

#### Two Paths, Two Masters

Romans 6 lays out a stark contrast:

- **Sin leads to death.**  
  Not just physical death, but spiritual deadness. A hardened heart. A life disconnected from the One who made us.

- **Obedience to God leads to righteousness.**  
  Not because we earn it, but because we align ourselves with the life and Spirit of Christ.

This isn’t about behavior modification—it’s about **lordship**.  
Who gets to be in charge of your life?

#### No Neutral Ground

We often like to think we can live in the “gray zone”—do a little of both. Go to church on Sunday, but live for ourselves the rest of the week.  
But Romans 6:16 reminds us: **There is no neutral ground.**

> You can’t serve both sin and God.  
> One leads to bondage.  
> The other leads to true freedom.

#### The Beauty of Obedience

Here’s the good news: **Obedience to God is not restrictive—it’s restorative.**

It leads to peace, purpose, and power. It aligns us with the very design of our lives.  
Jesus doesn’t just free us *from* sin—He frees us *for* something greater:  
a life of righteousness, fruitfulness, and deep joy.

#### Reflect

Ask yourself:

- What do I obey in my daily life—my impulses, my fears, the opinions of others?
- What would it look like to truly offer myself to God in obedience?

#### A Prayer

> “Lord, I don’t want to be a slave to sin.  
> I offer myself to You today—my time, my choices, my desires.  
> Help me walk in obedience, not out of duty, but out of love.  
> Make me a servant of righteousness, for Your glory. Amen.”

#### Final Thought

You were made to serve—but not as a slave to sin.  
You were made to serve a King who died to set you free.

> *"Choose you this day whom ye will serve;
> as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."*
> — **Joshua 24:15 (KJV)**
